# ESP8266 Keypad Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface a 4x4 matrix keypad with an ESP8266 microcontroller to read and display key presses. The keypad allows for user input through buttons, making it suitable for applications such as password entry, menu navigation, and user interfaces.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **4x4 Matrix Keypad**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard (optional)**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Keypad to the ESP8266:**
   - **Row Pins:** Connect the keypad row pins to the digital pins D1, D2, D3, and D4 on the ESP8266.
   - **Column Pins:** Connect the keypad column pins to the digital pins D5, D6, D7, and D8 on the ESP8266.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed.
   - Install the `Keypad` library from the Library Manager if not already installed.
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor.
   - Press various keys on the keypad.
   - Observe the corresponding key presses printed to the Serial Monitor.

#### Applications
- **Password Entry:** Use the keypad for secure password entry in security systems.
- **Menu Navigation:** Implement the keypad to navigate through menus in user interfaces.
- **User Interfaces:** Integrate the keypad for custom user input in various projects.

#### Notes
- **Debouncing:** The keypad library handles debouncing, but additional software debouncing can be implemented if necessary.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure a stable power supply to the ESP8266 and keypad for consistent operation.
- **Keypad Layout:** Verify the keypad layout and pin connections to match the defined keymap in the code.
